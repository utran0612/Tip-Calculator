Submitted by: Uyen Tran

Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [x] User can select between tip percentages by tapping different values on the segmented control and the tip value is updated accordingly

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] UI animations
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [x] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Tip Slider instead of a Segmented Control

## Notes
**Challenge while creating the program
- It took me a lot of time to download Xcode (6-7 hours).
- I created a wrong type of project (not iOS) at the beginning which brought a lot of confusion.
- Understand UIViewController, IBOutlet, IBAction.
- Sometimes it's hard to connect IBOutlets with the elements. Variable names have to be consistent and when I changed a name of an IBOutlet var I have to make sure that it is changed in other actions too; otherwise, the app will crash.
- I want to make corner radius but haven't found a way to do it.
